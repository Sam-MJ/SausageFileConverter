# SausageFileConverter
SausageFileConverter is a sound library consolidation tool that searches for single audio files that have variations and converts them into a sausage file.

Variations are defined as files that have the same name apart from a different number, such as metal_impact_01, metal_impact_02, metal_impact_03

A sausage file is a file that contains each of the variations in the same file with silence in between.
(the resulting wave form looks like a string of sausages)

The metadata from the first variation is then applied to the converted file. This includes all professional formats such as iXML, cart chunks, embedded images and proprietary encrypted formats certain tools embed.

Converting files in this way aids sound designers in:
* Traversing their sound library quickly
* Adding old libraries - which used to favour single files with variations
* Adding designed game assets and layers back into their library for use in future projects
